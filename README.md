# WGA analysis

## **Identify cell area in WGA stained cells**

The WGA macro can be used to calculate cell area in *.tif or *.jpg images of tissue samples stained for cell walls. It was written for WGA stained cells. The user has the choice to analyse the whole image, using a saved ROI, making one ROI to be used for all images or to draw a seperate ROI for each image. The result ROI images will be saved in jpg format and the ROI manager results will be saved as well (as zip file) to allow control over the results.
This macro needs the plugin: Rolling Ball Background.

## Download code

Select the file required (WGA, WGA3.1, Histo_2 or SEM ) and select "Raw" from the right side menu. Select all the code and copy and paste this into the text editor from ImageJ/Fiji (File > New > Text Window). Alternatively, you can download all files via the green "Code" button as a ZIP file and extract the macro files. Save these files in your macros sub-folder within the ImageJ or Fiji folder.
